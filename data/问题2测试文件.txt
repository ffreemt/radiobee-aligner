薄瓜瓜在薄熙来案开庭前夕再次发表声明
Bo Guagua’s Statement

Following is the statement that Bo Guagua released to The New York Times on Monday in English. Mr. Bo’s father, Bo Xilai, a former Chinese Communist Party official, is scheduled to go on trial on Thursday on charges of taking bribes, corruption and abuse of power.
下面是薄瓜瓜在周一《纽约时报》上发表的英文声明。他的父亲、前中国共产党官员薄熙来定于周四出庭受审，面临的指控是受贿、腐败和滥用职权。
It has been eighteen months since I have been denied contact with either my father or my mother. I can only surmise the conditions of their clandestine detention and the adversity they each endure in solitude. I hope that in my father’s upcoming trial, he is granted the opportunity to answer his critics and defend himself without constraints of any kind. However, if my wellbeing has been bartered for my father’s acquiescence or my mother’s further cooperation, then the verdict will clearly carry no moral weight. 
自从他们切断我与父亲和母亲的联系以来，已经18个月了。我只能猜测他们所受秘密拘禁的条件，以及他们各自忍受的孤独逆境。我希望，在我父亲即将面对的审判中，他能得到机会来回应对他的批评并为自己辩护，不会受到任何形式的约束。然而，如果我父亲的默然顺从或我母亲的进一步合作已经成为我获得平安的条件，判决显然不会具有任何道德分量。
My mother, who is now silenced and defenseless, cannot respond to the opportunistic detractors that attack her reputation with impunity. She has already overcome unimaginable tribulation after the sudden collapse of her physical health in 2006 and subsequent seclusion. Although it is of little comfort to my anxiety about her state of health, I know that she will continue to absorb all that she is accused of with dignity and quiet magnanimity.
我母亲已被禁言，孤立无援，无法回应投机的诽谤者对她声誉的肆意攻击。2006年，她的健康状况突然恶化，随后深居简出，自那以后，她已经克服了常人难以想象的艰难。我知道她会一如既往，以尊严和沉着气度化解她遭到的一切指控，虽然这并不能丝毫减少我对她健康状况的担忧。
