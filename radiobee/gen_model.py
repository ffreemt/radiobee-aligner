    Args:

        (refer to textacy.representation.Vectorizer)
        tf_type: Type of term frequency (tf) to use for weights' local component:

            - "linear": tf (tfs are already linear, so left as-is)
            - "sqrt": tf => sqrt(tf)
            - "log": tf => log(tf) + 1
            - "binary": tf => 1

        idf_type: Type of inverse document frequency (idf) to use for weights'
            global component:

            - "standard": idf = log(n_docs / df) + 1.0
            - "smooth": idf = log(n_docs + 1 / df + 1) + 1.0, i.e. 1 is added
              to all document frequencies, as if a single document containing
              every unique term was added to the corpus.
            - "bm25": idf = log((n_docs - df + 0.5) / (df + 0.5)), which is
              a form commonly used in information retrieval that allows for
              very common terms to receive negative weights.
            - None: no global weighting is applied to local term weights.

        dl_type: Type of document-length scaling to use for weights'
            normalization component:

            - "linear": dl (dls are already linear, so left as-is)
            - "sqrt": dl => sqrt(dl)
            - "log": dl => log(dl)
            - None: no normalization is applied to local(*global?) weights

        norm: If "l1" or "l2", normalize weights by the L1 or L2 norms, respectively,
            of row-wise vectors; otherwise, don't.
        min_df: Minimum number of documents in which a term must appear for it to be
            included in the vocabulary and as a column in a transformed doc-term matrix.
            If float, value is the fractional proportion of the total number of docs,
            which must be in [0.0, 1.0]; if int, value is the absolute number.
        max_df: Maximum number of documents in which a term may appear for it to be
            included in the vocabulary and as a column in a transformed doc-term matrix.
            If float, value is the fractional proportion of the total number of docs,
            which must be in [0.0, 1.0]; if int, value is the absolute number.
        max_n_terms: If specified, only include terms whose document frequency is within
            the top ``max_n_terms``.
        vocabulary_terms: Mapping of unique term string to unique term id, or
            an iterable of term strings that gets converted into such a mapping.
            Note that, if specified, vectorized outputs will include *only* these terms.

        “lucene-style tfidf”: Adds a doc-length normalization to the usual local and global components.
            Params: tf_type="linear", apply_idf=True, idf_type="smooth", apply_dl=True, dl_type="sqrt"

        “lucene-style bm25”: Uses a smoothed idf instead of the classic bm25 variant to prevent weights on terms from going negative.
            Params: tf_type="bm25", apply_idf=True, idf_type="smooth", apply_dl=True, dl_type="linear"
